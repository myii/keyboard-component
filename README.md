Additional Features
===================

* Horizontal swipe in the space bar triggers the **cursor mover mode** (press and hold still works)
* Double-tapping and dragging while in **cursor mover mode** will enter **selection mode**. You'll be able to select texts.
* Double-tapping and releasing while in **cursor mover mode** will select the current or previous word (similar to double clicking a word)
* While in **cursor mover mode**, advanced text actions are now available (copy, cut, paste, select all, tab, undo, redo)
* While in **cursor mover mode**, additional navigation buttons are available as floating buttons (Move/Select to start of line,Move/Select to end of line, exit current mode)

Ubuntu Keyboard
===============

Ubuntu Keyboard is the official QML and C++ based keyboard plugin for Ubuntu 
Touch. We follow an open source model where the code is available to anyone 
to branch and hack on.

Updating presage language models
================================

If the source material used for **presage** prediction models is updated, the 
databases can be regenerated by running `make lang_db_$lc` within the plugin's
**src** directory (where `$lc` is the language code for the updated language, 
e.g. `make lang_db_en` for English)


Building with crossbuilder
==========================
The easiest way to build this is using crossbuilder by simply running:

```
crossbuilder
```

See [crossbuilder on github](https://github.com/ubports/crossbuilder) for
